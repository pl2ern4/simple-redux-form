      Download Zip and extract it in any folder where git,node,npm are accessible. 
      
  ii) Using git :
       Open any folder in command prompt/gitbash/ powershell (powershell and command prompt must have git access) 
       and type give command and press "render".
       git clone https://github.com/pl2ern4/simple-redux-form.git

    If you are adding any number to any selected user, It won't be empty submitted.
    User can be deleted one at a time.

    Selected User's contact number can be added one at a time.

    Selected User's contact number can be deleted one at a time.

    New User Can be created from "Create New User" page which can be available on click of "Create User" button from main page.
