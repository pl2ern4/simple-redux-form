About:

This is very basic project in which I've used react, react-hook, react-router, redux and many more libraries.

Basic Requirements:

Operating System (Preffered):
 Windows 7 and latest
 Mac
 Linux
 
Mandatory Softwares:
 git
 npm
 node
 
 How to start with project?
 
 1) take clone of project 
 
  i) Using Zip:
      Download Zip and extract it in any folder where git,node,npm are accessible. 
      
  ii) Using git :
       Open any folder in command prompt/gitbash/ powershell (powershell and command prompt must have git access) 
       and type give command and press "render".
       git clone https://github.com/pl2ern4/simple-redux-form.git
       
Note : above command create folder with name "simple-redux-form" and download project file in that folder.      

 2) Enter in folder name "simple-redux-form" in console. 
  
 3) Enter "npm install && npm start" and press enter. (for installation of dependencies and start the module)
 
 After above application will open in default browser itself Or if default browser is not set, 
 It will ask you for the permission to open in any browser.
 
 
 This Application is basic demostration of use of react-router, react-hooks and many more.
